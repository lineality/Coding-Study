-- Write your MySQL query statement below

-- (User) Problem
-- We know/ We have: just one table with all employees, managers, salaries
-- We need / We don't have: which employees earn more than their managers
-- We must / requirements:
-- return only the name of those employees who earn more than their manager
--
-- Solution (Product)
-- use nested 'from'
-- note: conditionals vs. joins
-- note: aliasing

-- Using Alias Comparison
SELECT employee_table.Name AS Employee
FROM Employee as manager_table, -- Alias
     Employee as employee_table -- Alias
WHERE employee_table.ManagerId = manager_table.Id
      AND manager_table.Salary < employee_table.Salary
;

-- Using Join
select table1.Name AS Employee
from Employee as table1
inner join Employee as table2 on table1.ManagerId = table2.Id
where table2.Salary < table1.Salary
;

--
select table1.Name AS Employee
from Employee as table1,
     Employee as table2
where table2.Salary < table1.Salary and table1.ManagerId = table2.Id
;
