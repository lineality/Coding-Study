-- (User) Problem
-- We know/ We have: just one table with all employees, managers, salaries
-- We need / We don't have: which employees earn more than their managers
-- We must / requirements:
-- return only the name of those employees who earn more than their manager
--
-- Solution (Product)
-- 1 using joins
-- 2 using comparing alisas
-- 3 use nested 'from'?


-- 1 Using Alias Comparison
SELECT employee_table.Name AS Employee -- rename output
FROM Employee as manager_table, -- alias
     Employee as employee_table -- alias
WHERE employee_table.ManagerId = manager_table.Id
      AND manager_table.Salary < employee_table.Salary
;

-- 2 Using Join
select employee_table.Name AS Employee -- rename output
from Employee as employee_table -- alias
inner join Employee as manager_table -- alias
      on employee_table.ManagerId = manager_table.Id
where manager_table.Salary < employee_table.Salary
;
