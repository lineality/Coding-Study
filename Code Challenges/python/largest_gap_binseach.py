# Input/Output Example:
#
# Largest Gap
# Given a list of integers nums, return the largest difference of two consecutive integers in the sorted version of nums.

# Constraints

# n â‰¤ 100,000 where n is the length of nums
# Example 1
# Input

# nums = [4, 1, 2, 8, 9, 10]
# Output

# 4
# Reflect On, Improvements, Comparisons with other Solutions:
# using zip
# nums.sort()
# return max(b-a for a, b in zip(nums, nums[1:]))
