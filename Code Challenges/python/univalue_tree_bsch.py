Input/Output Example:
Univalue Tree
Given a binary tree root, return whether all values in the tree are the same.

Constraints

n â‰¤ 100,000 where n is the number of nodes in root
Example 1
Input
Visualize Tree
root =
2

2

2

2

2

Output
True
Explanation
Every node has the value 2

Example 2
Input
Visualize Tree
root =
2

2

2

9

Output
False
Explanation
There is a node with a value 9 while

Solution (Feature/Product)
    BFS Bredth first search,
    check to see if any change in value
    if so
    output false

    if no defv
