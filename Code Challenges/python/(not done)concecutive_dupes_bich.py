# Input/Output Example:
#Consecutive Duplicates
# Given a string s, consisting of "X" and "Y"s, delete the minimum number of characters such that there's no consecutive "X" and no consecutive "Y".

# Constraints

# n â‰¤ 100,000 where n is the length of s
# Example 1
# Input

# s = "YYYXYXX"
# Output

# "YXYX"
# Explanation

# One solution is to delete the first two "Y"s and the last "X".

# Solution (Feature/Product)
# 1. regex
# 2. iterate through and count blocks of x and y
# then return the sequence of those blocks

#    (Edge cases)
