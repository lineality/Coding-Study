User Problem
You Have:
You Need:
You Must:

Input/Output Example:
Word Machine
You are given a list of strings ops where each element is either:

A non-negative integer that should be pushed into a stack
"POP" meaning pop the top element in the stack
"DUP" meaning duplicate the top element in the stack
"+" meaning pop the top two and push the sum
"-" meaning pop the top two and push top - second
Return the top element in the stack after applying all operations. If there are any invalid operations, return -1.

Constraints

n â‰¤ 100,000 where n is the length of ops
Example 1
Input
ops = ["1", "5", "DUP", "3", "-"]

Output
-2

Explanation
Following the operations:

We push 1 into the stack: [1]
We push 5 into the stack: [1, 5]
We duplicate the top element: [1, 5, 5]
We push 3 into the stack: [1, 5, 5, 3]
We pop 3 and 5 and push their difference 3 - 5: [1, 5, -2]
We return the top element which is -2

Example 2
Input
ops = ["+"]

Output
-1

Explanation
There's no elements in the stack so this is invalid.
