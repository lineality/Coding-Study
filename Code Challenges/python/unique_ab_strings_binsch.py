# User Problem
# You Have: input string of a or b, b can change
# You Need: number of unique combinations
# You Must: 
#
# Input/Output Example:
#
# Unique ab Strings
# You are given a string s of "a" and "b"s. "a"s can stay "a" or turn into "b", but "b"s can't change.

# Return the number of unique strings that can be made.

# Constraints

# n â‰¤ 10,000 where n is the length of s
# Example 1
# Input

# s = "abba"
# Output

# 4

# Solution (Feature/Product)
# b is ignored
#    (Edge cases)
