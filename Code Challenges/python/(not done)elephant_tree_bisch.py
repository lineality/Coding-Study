Input/Output Example:
Elephant Tree
Given a binary tree root, return the same tree except every node's value is replaced by its original value plus all of the sums of its left and right subtrees.

Constraints

n â‰¤ 100,000 where n is the number of nodes in root
Example 1
Input
Visualize Tree
root = [2, [1, [0, null, null], null], [4, [3, null, null], null]]
Output
Visualize Tree
[10, [1, [0, null, null], null], [7, [3, null, null], null]]
